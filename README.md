## How to play

Adventure game is based on choices made by the player. To play the game the player is presented with different prompts, each prompt results to a different outcome. The player needs to select a choice that will advance to the next scenario by making sure they enter valid data in order to win the game. The player has to make sure to answer the answer thinking deep as to what the outcome will be. If the player mistakenly inputs invalid data, the player will be asked to try again.
